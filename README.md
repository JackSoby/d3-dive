# d3-dive

After much trail and error I got a simple bar chart to how up. I did learn that d3 + react is harder then you think. this article was very helpful https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/interactive-applications-with-react-d3-f76f7b3ebc71.

if you want to see what I got follow pull down the repo and run
```
bundle
rails s

```
in a new tab run

```
./bin/webpack-dev-server
```
